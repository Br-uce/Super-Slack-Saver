# Super-Slack-Saver
We decided to go a little more practical and real-world work.
Our two APIs are Docker API where you actually virtualize applications.
And the second API is Slack API as a notification APP.
How do they come together?
Docker is used is enterprises that have web services like banks when you go to pull your bank statement or when you pay an account. Those are all little apps running in the background.
As you see, these are important apps. But not perfect, sometimes these apps crash and need a human intervention. So this app, sends a notification on your slack to tell you when an app is down to let you know to take action.
## Built with
This app is built with Tailwind CSS, Docker API, Ubuntu Server, AWS CloudServer, NGINX Reverse Proxy, Slack API(intended), Zerotier VPN
